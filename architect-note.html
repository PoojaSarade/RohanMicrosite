        <p class="architect-text">Rohan Harita was designed as a space that seamlessly flows with the nature that surrounds it. Keeping this in mind, the structure adopted a contemporary, simplistic design. The desire was to create an exceptional piece of architecture. The aim was to do it while embracing the natural landscape.
 And we’ve gone to great lengths, to ensure every Rohan Harita Home makes you feel that way.</p>
        <p class="architect-text">Rohan Harita now stands as a luxurious residential space, with gardens and landscaping, mindfully crafted by preserving of the existing trees. As a site that hosts 1,2,3 and 4 BHK homes, with backyards and living rooms opening to the outdoors, this space would be a go-to retreat, for people across all ages and abilities. The amenities that you’ll find nestled in the Rohan Harita campus are designed to provide for a healthy, active lifestyle – with outdoor engagement spaces, community zones, multi-functional play courts, cycling / jogging tracks, a well-equipped gym, an amphitheater, and many other facilities. Harita also boasts of the sky facilities where one can spot expansive views of the stark cityscape and the skyline.</p>
        <p class="architect-text">Holistic Wellness, sustainable living, preserving bio-diversity, and peaceful co-existence with nature – these are values that Rohan Harita believes are essential to great living. And this project is a reflection of all of these. The Miyawaki Forest Zone, Forest Trails, and Reflexology path – are some features that are a testament to this.
        </p>
        <p class="architect-text">At the end of every day, as the bustle of your busy life settles, you should come home to a whiff of fresh air. That restores your calm. Relaxes your senses.
        </p>
        <p class="architect-text">Come home to a place, where you don’t just live. But you feel alive.
